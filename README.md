# STM32 Drivers
This project is inspired by and in parts based on previous work that considers rust as a language to implement full stack microcontroller software. It is used to explore the implementation of driver software in general. A specific goal of this project is to find ways to provide generalization across different models using the advanced features rust provides in contrast to C/C++.

Project status: pre-alpha
